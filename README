sfNewsletter plugin
===================

The `sfNewsletter` is a symfony plugin that provides basic newsletter support,
including subscription, unsubscription, activation of new entries and a task
to actually send newsletters.

Usage
-----

There are no assets used. You only have to activate the plugin.

Configuration
-------------

However you have to setup a small bit of configuration to get this plugin 
working. In settings.yml add this line:

    newsletterplugin_from: email@example.com
    
The mail address from which the newsletters are sent. 
This email will also receive any newsletter that is sent.

In app.yml you may want to prevent the plugin from registering its default
routes. If disabled, you have to add the specific routes yourself.

    newsletterplugin_routes_register: false
