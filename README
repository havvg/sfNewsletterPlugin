including subscription, unsubscription, activation of new entries and a task
to actually send newsletters.

Usage

There are no assets used. You only have to activate the plugin and its modules.

Configuration
-------------

However you have to setup a small bit of configuration to get this plugin 
working. In settings.yml add this line:

The mail address from which the newsletters are sent.
This email will also receive any newsletter that is sent.
